# Django_project_Graduation_Project

## Overview

This is my graduation project in the field of Bioinformatics, focusing on the analysis of large DNA data and the development of a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer.

## Project Structure

- **/data**: This directory contains the raw DNA data used for analysis.
- **/django_app**: The Django application for the project.
- **/machine_learning_model**: Implementation and documentation of the machine learning model.
- **/docs**: Project documentation.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Django_project_Graduation_Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Django_project_Graduation_Project
    ```

3. Set up the Django environment:

    ```bash
    # You may need to create a virtual environment first
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run migrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

4. Run the Django development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model is implemented in the `/machine_learning_model` directory. Refer to the documentation within that directory for more details on model training, evaluation, and usage.
