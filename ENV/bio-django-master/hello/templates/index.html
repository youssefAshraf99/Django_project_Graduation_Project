        This site provides a collection of easy-to-use sequence manipulation tools. These tools can be used to manipulate
        strings representing DNA, RNA, and peptide sequences for biomedical research. My intent is to add additional tools
        and improve existing ones over time.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        The Apps menu above will direct you to the various utilities on this site.
        The Sequences module provides access to a database of peptide, DNA, and RNA example sequences.
        Feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or suggestions.
